        philanthropy. One of his most significant contributions is the
        establishment of <strong> Khanum Memorial Cancer 
        Hospital in 1994,</strong>
        providing free cancer treatment to underprivileged patients. He also
        founded<strong> Namal University,</strong> aimed at providing world-class education to
        students in rural areas. His charitable efforts have made a lasting
        impact on Pakistan’s healthcare and education sectors.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1996, Imran Khan entered politics by founding<strong> Pakistan
        Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI),</strong> with a vision of justice and accountability.
        Though he faced challenges in gaining political ground, his persistence
        paid off when he won <strong> 2018 General Elections</strong> and 
        became the<strong></strong> Prime
        Minister of Pakistan.</strong> During his tenure, he introduced several reforms,
        including:<br />
       <strong>Ehsaas Program – </strong> Pakistan’s largest social welfare initiative for
        poverty alleviation.<br/>
        <strong> Sehat Card –</strong> Free healthcare services for millions
        of citizens.<br/>
        <strong> Naya Pakistan Housing Project – </strong>Affordable housing schemes
        for low-income families.<br/>
        <strong> Anti-Corruption Drive – </strong>Strengthening
        institutions to curb corruption and promote transparency.<br/>
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt-4">Challenges and Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Despite his achievements, Imran Khan faced political opposition,
        economic struggles, and governance challenges. His tenure as Prime
        Minister saw both progress and controversy. However, his commitment to a
       <strong> corruption-free and self-reliant Pakistan</strong> continues to inspire millions.
        Even after leaving office, he remains a powerful voice in Pakistan’s
        politics, especially among the youth.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Conclusion</h2>

         a<strong> transformational
        leader </strong> is a testament to his determination and vision. His

        to <strong> sports, philanthropy, and politics </strong> have shaped Pakistan in
        significant ways. Whether through his <strong> World Cup victory, charitable
        projects, or political leadership,</strong> his impact remains undeniable. His
